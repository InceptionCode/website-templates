# Website Templates

This repo and project is inspired by [W3C's Templates](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp). The goal was to reinvent or redevelop those templates.

## Technologies Used
I use standard HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and a CDN for [font-awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). I also included [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) just to have a start command that allows me to use [browser-sync.](https://www.browsersync.io/)
Both Node and browser-sync are unnecessary. However, if you wish to use both click on the Node.js link and follow their installation instructions, then copy my package.json file. Next, click on the broswer-sync link and look for (Node.js) instruction to follow for installation.
You should install browser-sync globally with node. 

## Viewing The Templates

In order to view the templates you simply have to download the project folder and navigate to the HTML folder. Once there you can click on any HTML file and view the template(s).
While on an HTML5 on the right hand side of the document or webpage you should see a black tab with an arrow icon inside. This button or tab will provide direct links to other templates once clicked on.


## Contribution

All issues and pull request are accepted here. If you wish to contribute carefully leave an issue with detailed suggestions along with detailed pull requests.
You don't need Node or Browser-sync in your workflow or development build just to contribute. Those technologies where only in use to make my development process shorter and easier.
Provide descriptions or explanations for the changes that you wish to make. If you see any grammatical issues or an issue with this README file feel free to fix the issues. Any other support or advice will also be appreciated thanks!
